# LIBFT - your own standard library for C #

## This is my libft project for 42-Cursus Madrid 2021 ##

- **Status:** *Finished*
- **Result:** *115/100 by moulinette*

Contact: ldurante@student.42madrid.com

This is the very first project you have to face as a student. It is quite simple: replicate some very useful functions from the standard library in C.
You'll have to learn how to compare strings, join them, delete chars, convert them into integers... etc. Also as a bonus we must make some functions to create lists and move/delete/add elements from them.
As we are given very limited libraries and base functions to use in the future projects, it is important to make your own libft as good as possible, because you'll depend on it most of the time.

the names of the functions are exactly the same as the ones we are trying to replicate, but adding "ft_" (might stand for "function" or "forty-two", or both) in front of them.

### *UPDATE: I've been adding new functions as i've been finishing projects and making new useful functions. Also added ft_printf and get_next_line to be included in my libft.* ###
